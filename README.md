# Main — design reference

This is a design mockup created in a visual design tool (an appifact
design canvas), exported as a standalone page. Treat it as a REFERENCE
MOCKUP, not production code: the markup and inline styles carry the
design's precise values — colors, font sizes, spacing, radii, shadows,
layout — which an implementation should replicate faithfully in its own
components and styling system rather than copy wholesale.

## Contents

- `Main.dc.html` — the artboard (a Design Component: an `<x-dc>`
  template + a small logic class). The values to replicate live in its
  inline `style="…"` attributes and the `<helmet><style>` block.
- `assets/` — files uploaded to the design (images, fonts, media)
- `support.js`, `vendor/react*.js` — the runtime that renders the
  component in a browser; not part of the design.

## Uploaded files

Images, fonts and media uploaded to the design are written once each under
`assets/` — 10 in this export — and the exported files refer to them there. A
reference a script puts together while the page runs (for example
`"/_blob/" + id`) is not rewritten and does not load from this folder.

## Viewing

Serve the folder (e.g. `python3 -m http.server`) and open `Main.dc.html`;
some browsers block the scripts over file://.
